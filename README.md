# KNN-Perceptron-SVM-Passive-Aggressive <br />

Implementation of the KNN, Perceptron, SVM, and Passive Aggressive algorithmes for classification.<br />

The dataset is the Iris flower classification.<br />
In this dataset, there is five features per instance (all the features are numerical ) and three labels,<br />
which are correspond to the Iris flower species. <br />

In order to run the algorithem, write the following line:<br />
python ex2.py <train_x_path> <train_y_path> <test_x_path> <output_log_name><br />
